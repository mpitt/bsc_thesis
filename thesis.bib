	abstract = {Systems as diverse as genetic networks or the World Wide Web are best described as networks with complex topology. A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

@misc{clauset_power-law_????,
	title = {Power-law distributions in empirical data},
	abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution—the part of the distribution representing large but rare events— and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power- law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.},

	abstract = {This document describes the Optimized Link State Routing ({OLSR)}
protocol for mobile ad hoc networks.  The protocol is an optimization
of the classical link state algorithm tailored to the requirements of
a mobile wireless {LAN.}  The key concept used in the protocol is that
of multipoint relays ({MPRs).}  {MPRs} are selected nodes which forward
broadcast messages during the flooding process.  This technique
substantially reduces the message overhead as compared to a classical
flooding mechanism, where every node retransmits each message when it
receives the first copy of the message.  In {OLSR}, link state
information is generated only by nodes elected as {MPRs.}  Thus, a
second optimization is achieved by minimizing the number of control
messages flooded in the network.  As a third optimization, an {MPR}
node may chose to report only links between itself and its {MPR}
selectors.  Hence, as contrary to the classic link state algorithm,
partial link state information is distributed in the network.  This
information is then used for route calculation.  {OLSR} provides
optimal routes (in terms of number of hops).  The protocol is
particularly suitable for large and dense networks as the technique
of {MPRs} works well in this context.},

This software package provides easy commands for basic fitting and statistical analysis of distributions. Notably, it also seeks to support a variety of user needs by being exhaustive in the options available to the user. The code is publicly available and easily extensible.},

	volume = {406},
	abstract = {Many complex systems display a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. For example, relatively simple organisms grow, persist and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental interventions, an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying metabolic network1. Complex communication networks2 display a surprising degree of robust- ness: although key components regularly malfunction, local fail- ures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the func- tional web defined by the systems’ components. Here we demon- strate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems: it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks, which include the World-Wide Web3–5, the Internet6, social networks7 and cells8. We find that such networks display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected even by un- realistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play a vital role in maintaining the network’s connectivity). Such error tolerance and attack vulnerability are generic properties of communication networks.},
